    "raw_code": "rst of all we need to understand what is being asked in this problem statement and how it's supposed work with python programming language as given below- \n\nProblem Statement : Given a list or array `words` which contains strings (i.e., words), return an index position that can be found within the provided string where word(in our case, character x) is present inside them in such way we get all indices of those specific characters/word from given input .\n   - Here are some examples:  ['apple', 'banana'], if char='a': output should include [0],[1] and so on. In other words list indexes where the word(i) contains character x (in our case, a). If there is no such characters in any string then we return an empty array []\n   - Also note that indexing starts from 0 for each substring present inside given input strings which are compared against char `x`. Similarly when 'b' found it should be at position [1], and if multiple times of a character is used, all occurrences positions will return in list (i , e..)\n    - The program must run within the function find_words_containing(...).  In this problem statement `list[str]` signifies that it's an array or List containing strings. And for output we need to get indexes of these words which contain character x, if no such word present then return empty list []\n   - The input format will be : a two-dimensional string Array and one char  (a single letter). It is expected as [['apple', 'banana'],'b'] or ([[\"abc\", \"def\"],\"d\"] ,'c') etc. In the first case array of strings contains multiple words, in second it has an additional word to find within them\n   - For example: If `words` = ['hello','worlds']) and char= 'w': function should return [1] as that is index position where character \"x\" (which we are looking for) appears. And if the array of strings was given like this :['goodbye', 'see'] ,'o'(to find within them), it will output []\n   - The code must be efficient and performant, with an execution time complexity less than O(n^2).  Here n is number of elements in our input list. This can significantly reduce the runtime on large arrays/lists since we are essentially iterating over each character only once through every word within given array or string .\n   - The function signature should be def find_words_containing (...): it takes two arguments, a 2-dimensional List of Strings and one Character. It returns an Array representing the indices positions where our specified char is present in those words inside input list/array strings.. And if no such word exists within given string then return []\n   - The function will be called by passing parameters to it as described above: e.g., find_words_containing(['hello', 'worlds'],'w') or  (['goodbye','see'] ,'o'). It should print [1] if the word contains char `x` and [] otherwise\n   - The function will be tested with various inputs such as a large list of strings, an empty string etc. to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly . If any issue is found in code optimization then that needs revising here before merging back into master branch (if possible).  Please share the final version if there are no issues or further steps needed",
